Free as the wind was he
他像风般自由
Like a soaring kite was he
他像风筝般高飞
Where did he go, let's find him
他去哪儿，让我们找他吧
We were led by the path we took
我们靠前人的路引导
While he carved a path of his own
但他却自己铺路
Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he
跌倒，爬起，他无忧无虑地前行
We fretted about the morrow
我们为明日之忧烦恼
He simply reveled in today
他却今朝有酒今朝醉
Living each moment to the fullest
让每一分钟活得充实
Where did he come from
他来自何方？
He who touched our hearts and vanished
触动了我们的心，之后消失
